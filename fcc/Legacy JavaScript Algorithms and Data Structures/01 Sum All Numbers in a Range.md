We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers
plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not
always come first.

For example, `sumAll([4,1])` should return `10` because sum of all the numbers
between `1` and `4` (both inclusive) is `10`.

```javascript
function sumAll(arr) {
  return 1;
  }

  sumAll([1, 4]);
```

sumAll([1, 4]) should return a number.
Waiting:sumAll([1, 4]) should return 10.
Waiting:sumAll([4, 1]) should return 10.
Waiting:sumAll([5, 10]) should return 45.
Waiting:sumAll([10, 5]) should return 45.
