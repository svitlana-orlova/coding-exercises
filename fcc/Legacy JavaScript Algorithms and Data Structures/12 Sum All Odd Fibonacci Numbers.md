Given a positive integer `num`, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers
that are less than or equal to `num`.

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1. Every
additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers.
The first seven numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and
8.

For example, `sumFibs(10)` should return `10` because all odd Fibonacci numbers
less than or equal to `10` are 1, 1, 3, and 5.

```javascript
function sumFibs(num) {
  return num;
}

sumFibs(4);
```

sumFibs(1) should return a number.
Waiting:sumFibs(1000) should return 1785.
Waiting:sumFibs(4000000) should return 4613732.
Waiting:sumFibs(4) should return 5.
Waiting:sumFibs(75024) should return 60696.
Waiting:sumFibs(75025) should return 135721.
