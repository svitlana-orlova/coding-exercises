Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one
of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric
difference of the two arrays.

Note: You can return the array with its elements in any order.

```javascript
function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
  const newArr = [];
  return newArr;
}

diffArray([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```
